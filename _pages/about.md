**About Me**

Hello! I am Anirban Chakraborty. I have done my PhD under the guidance of Prof. Debdeep Mukhopadhyay and am currently working as a senior researcher in his laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. I have submitted my thesis to the institute and am awaiting my thesis defence seminar.

The fascinating world of side channels, especially systems security, has always intrigued me which eventually led me to pursue PhD from IIT Kharagpur, a premier higher education and research institute in India. My PhD thesis topic was “Exploration of Side-Channel Leakages in Modern Computer Architectures”. From the early days of 8086 processors (the processor that gave birth to x86 architecture) operating at 10MHz to the modern-day heavy-duty processors working at more than 6GHz clock (peak frequency), the world of microprocessors has ushered through tremendous and arguably exponential growth. The processor manufacturers are constantly improving both process technology and introducing hardware-software optimizations to increase the performance of their processors year-on-year. However, with new optimizations to the microarchitecture, comes new leakage sources and vulnerabilities. As manufacturers introduce new and often undisclosed optimizations with each processor generation,  my PhD research delves into a detailed exploration of side-channel vulnerabilities in modern processors, arising due to different performance optimization features. In my research, I scrutinize how the microarchitectural intricacies evolve from one generation to another, exploring the delicate balance between performance gains and the inadvertent creation of new avenues for security threats. In this pursuit, I have discovered novel timing side channels in modern processors by exploiting page frame cache, return address stack, and store-to-load forwarding. I have also analyzed the security guarantees of state-of-the-art randomized cache designs with respect to both contention and occupancy attacks and proposed an automated framework to discover novel transient leakage paths in modern processors. In addition, I have worked extensively on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) where we showed that cryptographic signature verification checks can be bypassed on OpTEE (open source TEE operating system) by using electromagnetic radiation. Apart from microarchitectural research, I am also interested in other associated aspects of hardware security. I have contributed significantly to multiple research papers related to symmetric key ciphers, physically unclonable functions, security of machine learning applications, and fully homomorphic encryption.
