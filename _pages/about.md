**Hello! I am Anirban Chakraborty**

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), jointly hosted by [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter/index.shtml) and [Yuval Yarom](https://yuval.yarom.org/). Additionally, I am also a visiting researcher at [Ruhr Universitaet Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/en/). Previously, I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Debdeep Mukhopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/view/debdeepmukhopadhyay/home) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). My research interests span all aspects of Hardware Security with a primary focus on Microarchitecture and Systems Security. I am particualrly interested in designing and testing of secure systems, Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and security evaluation of cryptographic applications such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes, Symmetric Key Cryptosystems, Physically Unclonable Functions, etc.
